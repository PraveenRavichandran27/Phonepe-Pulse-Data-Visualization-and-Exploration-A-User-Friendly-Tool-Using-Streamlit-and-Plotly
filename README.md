# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-A-User-Friendly-Tool-Using-Streamlit-and-Plotly

## Problem statement:

The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to
various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain
insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

The solution must include the following steps:
1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it..
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.
4. Create a visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
The solution must be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The dashboard must be
easily accessible and provide valuable insights and information about the data in the
Phonepe pulse Github repository.

## Utilized Applications and packages:

* Python
* MySQL
* Streamlit
* Pandas
* OS
* Github
* Plotly
  

## Approach:

To begin my project, I cloned the data from the Phonepe Pulse Github repository to my computer. With the help of the os package, I was able to identify and extract all of the necessary information from all directories & files.

This project consists of three phases: extracting, cleaning & uploading data, and visualizing the same. Each phase is equally important in this endeavor in order to produce the desired outcome.

### For Extracting and cleaning:
I utilized the json package to extract information from all the files, which were in Json format, and identified required information.

### For Data Transfer:
Extracted valuable data uploaded to mysql-connector with a mysql in a stuctured way and same for retrieving it back for data visualizing.

### Data Visualization:
The streamlit Web Application package was used to create a Phonepe overview with five tabs and multiple filtering options to see detailed insight about the data. These tabs include Transaction type and device information, geo map visualization, and the top ten states/districts/areas for Phonepe transactions & user registrations.
